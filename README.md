# LaSPeX
LaTeX package for typesetting scripts

This project is to modernize the old SPeX class that the student-comedy group
Fysikalen used back in the day. That was written in XeTeX which is very annoying
language. LaSPeX on the other hand compiles using pdfLaTeX which is more widely
used today. This makes collaboration easier throught platforms such as Overleaf.
